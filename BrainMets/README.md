# Brain Metastases' mesoscopic model

### A discrete, stochastic, on-lattice, multicompartmental, mesoscale and 3D computational simulation tool to study growth laws of brain metastases

## 1. Motivation

Here we put forward an adapted version of the mesoscopic model to reproduce brain metastases.


## 2. Prerequisites

In order to run simulations of brain metastases with this version of the mesoscopic model, you need an installation of Julia, some specific Julia packages, and the model's core modules.

### 2.1 Installing Julia

Please take a look at the tutorial provided in the main page of [this repository](https://github.com/JuanJS117/MesoscopicModel/tree/main)

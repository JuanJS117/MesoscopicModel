# MesoscopicModel1.0

## A discrete, stochastic, on-lattice, multicompartmental, mesoscale and 3D computational simulation tool to study evolutionary dynamics and heterogeneity during tumor growth

1. ##  Description

Here we present

2. ##  Installation and required packages

To run a tumor simulation, you need to install Julia in your computer. You can download Julia from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Search for the proper version depending on your platform (Windows, macOS or Linux), and follow the [platform specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

The model requires some Julia built-in packages to be preinstalled before running simulation. Once you have installed Julia in your computer, you can download and install any Julia package by opening the Julia Command-Line (type `julia` in your terminal) and typing the following commands:

    use Pkg
    Pkg.add("Package Name")
    
The required packages are "Distributions", "Random", and "DelimitedFiles". Once you have installed all of them, you can go back to terminal prompt by typing `close()` in your Julia Command-Line.
